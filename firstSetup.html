    <p><strong>Developing in Linux</strong><br>
    to start off with, open your terminal and navigate to a directory you're comfortable 
    putting the repo in. Before you start, make sure you have pipenv installed. You can do this by
    typing in the terminal "pip3 install pipenv", then going into your project directory
    and typing in "pipenv install".<br><br>Once you've finished, go ahead and clone the <a href="https://github.com/JHeflinger/RM-TEMPLATE" target="_blank">template project</a> into your directory with the command "git clone "<insert link here>"". Once you've cloned the project, 
    cd into the Project folder, and type in your terminal "pipenv shell". This instantiates 
    your shell environment. You can think of this as opening up your environment, meaning
    you will have to do this every time you wish to start developing. Inside the Project 
    folder contains your src folder, and within that the main.cpp file. This will hold your
    central program, and is what you need to be centrally concerned with coding. Go ahead
    and poke around it and see what's happening and if you can see what the program should do!

    Before we get ready to flash, make sure your board and ST-Link is properly plugged in!
    If you don't know what I'm talking about, refer <a href="hardwareSetup.html" target="_blank">here</a> for setting up your hardware.
    <br><br>
    Now is the moment you've been waiting for, flashing the code! MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN THE 
    "Project" DIRECTORY AND NOT THE SRC DIRECTORY!!! Go ahead and type in "scons build" in the
    terminal. You should see a bunch of C++ compile messages for a while until it completes.
    When you do this again later, it'll be much shorter. This command builds your code,
    and prepares it to flash. Once this is finished, type in "scons run", and wait as you
    flash your code! Once it's done, you should see the "A" led on your board blink! If so,
    congratulations, you've successfully set up your development environment. To learn more
    about the development process, go back to the home page and look at our code overview!
    <br><br>
    IMPORTANT: whenever you want to flash your code, you will have to use both "scons build"
    and "scons run"!!

    iiiiimmmm gonna write this later since I kinda forgot how to lol. In the meantime, either
    ask anthony or follow the tutorial at the bottom of the default <a href="https://github.com/JHeflinger/RM-TEMPLATE" target="_blank">template project</a>. Contact me if you have
    any problems and such.
