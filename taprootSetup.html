    <p><strong>Before Getting Started</strong><br>
    Taproot is meant for Linux machines. In other words, if you have the ability to do this on a Linux
    system, PLEASE DO SO. Although there is an option to develop on windows, the setup is infinitely
    less confusing than the windows setup. If you're a CS major or have to take CSSE332 at some point,
    you're gonna have to put Linux on your machine anyway, so maybe this is a good sign to get set up
    and start getting used to it. If so, contact me and I can help you get started. You can also 
    use virtualbox to run a VM instead of linux, which is pretty easy to set up if you're okay with
    developing with a 2 second time lag. In this page, I'll mostly be just directing you to official
    setup tutorials with a few words of advice for installation for our specific situation.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Option 1: Linux Installation</strong><br>
    If you already have Linux installed, go ahead and skip to "Taproot with Linux". If not, we will
    be installing Ubuntu as a dual boot on your machine. (if you have an option to do a complete 
    install on a separate device, that is ideal, but it's likely you have one machine and still
    need windows for your normal day-to-day) IMPORTANT: if you wanna have a superiority complex and
    install Arch or something, that's cool but DO NOT DO THIS if you've never used linux before. 
    Configuring more complicated distrobutions of Linux should be left to the experienced, but if
    you're really insistent, go contact Jacob Consalvi (jjc8266#2999) and beg for help. 
    Otherwise, you might just ruin your laptop.<br><br>
    Anyway, installing Ubuntu is fairly straight forward. I won't bother with typing out an entire
    tutorial when there's a million online. Click <a href="https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-1404-dual-boot-mode-windows-8-81-uefi/" target="_blank">here</a> for a good tutorial on how to set up dual boot.
    At most, you'll need to set aside roughly 30 gigs of space for this partition, since we won't need
    to install anything huge for this. If you need a spare flash drive, or are just nervous about the
    possibility of turning your computer to doggy doo, go ahead and contact me and I can help you out.
    Quick warning, your finger print scanner won't work most of the time when booting to windows after
    using linux, so just be prepared for that. It still works, just not on startup usually when you first
    log in.

    <p><strong>Option 2: Linux with VirtualBox Installation</strong><br>
    So, you choose the option to code with a 2 second lag. Well, it's probably the easiest option,
    so I don't blame you. Just click <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview" target="_blank">here</a> for the easiest tutorial.
    Once you're done, go ahead and move on to "Taproot with Linux" to start installig taproot.
