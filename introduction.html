    <p><strong>Let's Talk About Robomasters</strong><br>
    If you don't know anything about Robomasters, just go ahead and look it up. TLDR, we do
    robot overwatch with an undersized team and little to no experience. This competition in particular
    is based from a Chinese program, which unfortunately means there is little to no documentation
    or tutorials on how the hell to get started, and the little bits and pieces available 
    are in technical chinese. Which none of us know how to read or translate. As a result, some
    smart people from the beloved university of washington put together something called
    Taproot to help.

    <p><strong>Ok, cool. What is Taproot?</strong><br>
    In baby terms, Taproot is a library we can use to program the Robomaster Type A boards. Or more
    importantly, a DOCUMENTED library with a COMMUNITY that can HELP as opposed to the breadcrumbs of
    "fuck you, go figure it out" DJI sometimes leaves us. Rather than trying to search up obscure and 
    outdated forums for a way to set up outdated versions of KEIL and struggling to figure out how to
    use a board mentioned approximately 2 times on the entirety of the internet, Taproot has an actual
    Documented setup, tutorial, and documentation! However, to a new team and members who's experience
    consists of using eclipse and Java in their CSSE220 class, this can still be fairly intimidating.
    Which is why I'm making this barebones site to help guide you in a little more hand-holdy fashion.
