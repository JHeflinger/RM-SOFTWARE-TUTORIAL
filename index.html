    <p><strong>ATTENTION:</strong> this website is in its very early stages, so keep in mind that not everything is put together just quite yet! Please be mindful of errors, and if you see any bugs, have suggestions, or have any questions not covered in the tutorial, contact Jason Heflinger using the contact info above. You will likely get a response fastest with just a text to my cell, but any communication method is fine. Good luck! </p><br>
