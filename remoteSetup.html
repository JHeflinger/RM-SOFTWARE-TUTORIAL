    <p><strong>Step 1</strong><br>
    Getting the remote set up is actually pretty easy. You just need to connect your board
    to the remote DR16 reciever, like shown in the photo, and connect your board to power.
    IMPORTANT: your reciever will NOT connect unless your board is connected to a battery
    or power supply. This means that plugging in your 3 volt ST-Link will not work.

    <p><strong>Step 2</strong><br>
    Next, turn on your actual remote. There should be a box of these drone controllers
    in our shelves in the KIC. Once your remote is on, your reciever should start to 
    either blink green or just have a solid green LED. If it's solid, congratulations,
    your remote is now connected! If it's blinking, you'll just have to take a small
    pin and push it down into the hole on the reciever as shown below. Hold it down
    until the LED starts blinking red. Then release, and wait as the LED turns solid 
    green! If your LED is still red, bring the remote closer, or make sure your remote 
    is charged and your board is plugged into a proper power source.

    <p><strong>Step 3</strong><br>
    Time to write your first remote code! Click <a href="mainRemote.html" target="_blank">here</a> for
    some code to start you off with! Go ahead and copy/paste it into your main.cpp file, and play around with it. If all goes well,
    running this code should make the "A" LED spin when you flip the left switch up!
